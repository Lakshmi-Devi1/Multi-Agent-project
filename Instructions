Stock Price Agent using LangChain & yFinance
🔹 Project Overview
A smart assistant that fetches and visualizes stock prices using LangChain and yFinance.
Users can ask for stock prices using natural language, and the system extracts the ticker and retrieves real-time data.
🔹 Key Features
✅ AI-Powered Query Handling – Users can type queries like "Get the stock price of Microsoft".
✅ Real-Time Stock Price Retrieval – Uses yfinance API to get updated stock prices.
✅ Stock Data Visualization – Plots 1-month closing price trends using matplotlib.
✅ Automated Ticker Extraction – Uses regex to detect stock ticker symbols.
✅ Agent-Based Workflow – Uses LangChain to process requests efficiently.

🔹 Tech Stack Used
🔸 Python – Core programming language
🔸 LangChain – AI-driven query handling
🔸 Google Gemini AI – LLM integration for smart responses
🔸 yFinance – Fetching real-time stock data
🔸 Matplotlib – Data visualization for stock trends

🔹 Example Stock Ticker Codes
🔹 AAPL – Apple
🔹 GOOGL – Alphabet (Google)
🔹 MSFT – Microsoft
🔹 TSLA – Tesla
🔹 AMZN – Amazon
🔹 NFLX – Netflix

🔹 How It Works (Step-by-Step)
1️⃣ User Query – Example: "What is the stock price of GOOGL?"
2️⃣ Extract Ticker Symbol – Regex detects GOOGL.
3️⃣ Fetch Stock Data – Uses yfinance to get the latest closing price.
4️⃣ Return Stock Price – Displays stock price & optionally visualizes a 1-month trend.

🔹 Project Overview
This project is an AI-powered stock price assistant that allows users to query stock prices using natural language. It extracts the ticker symbol, fetches real-time stock prices, and provides data visualization for stock trends.

🚀 How to Replicate This Project
1️⃣ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
✅ Python (>=3.8)
✅ Required Python libraries (pip install -r requirements.txt)
✅ A Google Gemini AI API Key

2️⃣ Get Your Google Gemini AI API Key
Go to Google AI Studio and sign in.
Navigate to API Keys and generate a new key.
Copy the API key.
3️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-agent.git
4️⃣ Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dependencies Included:
langchain
langchain-google-genai
yfinance
matplotlib
python-dotenv

5️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root directory.
Add your Google Gemini API key inside it:
ini
Copy
Edit
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

🔹 Running the Project
1️⃣ Running main.py (Stock Price Retrieval & Visualization)
Run the main.py file to fetch stock prices using AI and generate a visualization:

python main.py

Prompts you for a query (e.g., "Get the stock price of Microsoft").

Uses Google Gemini AI & yfinance to fetch the latest stock price.

Returns the latest stock price in real-time.

Automatically generates a stock price trend graph for the last month using matplotlib.
📌 Example Output:

💰 Latest stock price for MSFT: $345.67
📊 Stock price visualization displayed.

✔ Graph Output:
A matplotlib plot displaying Microsoft's (MSFT) closing prices over the past month.

2️⃣ Running stock_tool.py (Stock Price Visualization Only)
If you only want to visualize stock trends without querying AI, run:

🔹 Example Stock Ticker Codes
🔹 AAPL – Apple
🔹 GOOGL – Alphabet (Google)
🔹 MSFT – Microsoft
🔹 TSLA – Tesla
🔹 AMZN – Amazon
🔹 NFLX – Netflix
